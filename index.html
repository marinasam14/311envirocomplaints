	Living in New York City welcomes a plethora of issues: subway delays, bad roommates, insects and rodents from the most unlikely places. But living in an old building with environmental health hazards is almost guaranteed, along with a landlord who would rather ignore the issues than fix it. That is when most people turn to 311.

	In 2024, nearly 9,000 complaints were filed across the city, reporting poor indoor air quality, mold, or asbestos in buildings. According to 311 data, the Upper West Side, Central Harlem North, Pomonok-Flushing Heights-Hillcrest, Hudson Yards-Chelsea-Flatiron-Union Square, and Crown Heights North all report the highest number of indoor environmental complaints.

	Although these neighborhoods call 311 the most, many New Yorkers hesitate reporting their building violations out of fear of landlord retaliation. However, not every vocal neighborhood has a low eviction filing rate. This can be attributed to factors such as a neighborhood that is being actively gentrified, or if a community is particularly outspoken about their living conditions.
	<br></br>
	</p><p>
	The Bronx, which had the highest mold complaints in 2023, now has one of the lowest of all the boroughs in 2024 according to a study by RentHop. Cornell ILR Eviction Filings Dashboard shows that the Bronx also experiences the second highest number of eviction filings amongst all the New York State counties.

	Samiha Mazumder, 23, worries about the black mold in her mother’s apartment in Jamaica, Queens where the eviction filing rate is almost 9%. Like many other New Yorkers, Mazumder and her mother are concerned that if they report the landlord’s lack of action to 311, he will evict her widowed mother from her childhood home.
	<br></br>
	</p><p>
	Mazumder stated, “I don’t want her to lose the apartment because it is the last place my dad lived with us.”
